%\section{Steps and Substeps}\label{sec:stepsAndSubsteps}

%\subsection{Exploration}\label{sec:Exploration}
%Exploration is the starting point of a supply chain. Phase which encompasses Mineral Prospecting and Geological Survey.

%\subsubsection{Prospecting/ Surveying}\label{sec:Prospecting}
%Prospecting means the search of mineral occurrences/surveying means the research on a mineralised area, previously defined during the prospecting phase to be applied as a Mineral Right from the Mining Authority.

%\subsubsection{Mining right application}\label{sec:Mining}
%Through handing over documents to the Mining Authority (in Brazil it is Agência Nacional de Mineração [ANM]).

%\subsubsection{Geological Survey}\label{sec:GeologicalSurvey}
%Geological Survey is a set of activities carried out to determine the features on quality and quantity of ore found in a given mineral deposit.

%\subsubsection{Mineral reserve definition}\label{sec:MineralReserve}
%this step is related to the quantity of ore found during the Geological Survey.

%\subsection{Mine Development and Design}\label{sec:MineDevelopment}
%In this phase is made the preparation of a deposit to become a mine, opening accesses, setting up fences, building benches.


%\subsection{Production}\label{sec:Production}
%Production phase including ore extraction and mineral processing or transformation.

%\subsubsection{Quarrying/ Blasting plan}\label{sec:Quarrying}
%Quantity of stone extracted, same quantity of mineral reserves depleted, type of stone extracted.

%\subsubsection{Processing}\label{sec:Processing}
%Quantity of stone crushed/processed, same quantity of stone in stock deducted, type of stone product, market requirements.

%\subsubsection{Aggregate Product}\label{sec:AggregateProduct}
%Listing of products with identified quantities and respective technological features.

%\subsection{Distribution}\label{sec:Distribution}
%Product distribution with identification of clients and their segmentation. 

%\subsubsection{Client by Product Type}\label{sec:Client}
%Name, address, size, sector, business registration numbers (federal, state, municipal, county).

%\subsubsection{Transport}\label{sec:Transport}
%Invoice, bills, type of transportation, weight, distance.

%\subsection{Mine Closure}\label{sec:MineClosure}
%Mine Closure or mineral decommissioning, it means the end of the mining activity and the start of the installations removal and area remodelling through plantation and/or building a lake.

%\subsubsection{Legal Compliance/Decommissioning Plan}\label{sec:LegalCompliance}
%Status of all documentation related to the Decommissioning Plan and its Legal Compliance.

%\subsubsection{Environmental Recovery/ ANM %Application}\label{sec:EnvironmentalRecovery}
%Application number and status.
